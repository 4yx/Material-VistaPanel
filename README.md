# Material VistaPanel
This project will create a VistaPanel theme that looks great with Materialize.  
Originally developed by [PlanetCloud](https://github.com/PlanetGamingGG) and [Tristian](https://github.com/OrdinaryJellyfish), now maintained by [PCTipsGR](https://github.com/PCTipsGR).

## How to install
You need to:
1. Go to your [MyOwnFreeHost Panel](https://panel.myownfreehost.net)  
2. Go to the "Your Adverts" section and select “Control Panel Advert Control”  
3. Select your domain from the list and click on “Add/Change Panel Adverts”  
4. Add the following code in the Footer advertising area:  

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/PCTipsGR/Material-VistaPanel/style.css" />
`  

## About the theme
This is a small, basic theme, that is created as a template for people who want to create their own theme based on that.  
I might develop it more, but currently I don't have the time.  

Any contribution is welcome, please submit a PR to get started.
