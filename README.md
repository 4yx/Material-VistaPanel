# VistaPanel Material Design Theme  

This project will create a vPanel theme that looks great with Materialize. It was developed by PlanetCloud and maintained now by PCTipsGR.

PlanetCloud and Tristian would also develop their own theme which would surely be better that this, but something happened and PDN has not time for this.  

This is just an Alpha Release, to show the basic functions.

# Waiting time  
I am busy at the moment. It might take a few months to be done :)
